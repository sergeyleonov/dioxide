# Dioxide - Android App for Visualizing the CO2 Meter Data

An energy-efficient full-time fullscreen "clock" that shows the CO2 concentration that is read from the sensor connected to the phone via the USB phone port.

This makes a nice standalone device supplied by the phone battery. On my old phone does about 3 hours run time on one charge. I also intend to power this setup via the battery connector from the power adaptor and build an enclosure to make a complete wall-mount device.

I am not an Android professional, so I borrowed the basic HID project from [https://github.com/Foxek/usb-custom-hid](https://github.com/Foxek/usb-custom-hid)

The code implementing the interaction with the CO2 meter was borrowed from the `co2java` project
